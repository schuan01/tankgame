# Tank Game Prototype by Juan Volpe

This is a fast prototype created in just 1 labor day using Unreal Engine 5.1 with BP and C++

For faster iteration on Gameplay, I started everything in BP and I will be moving the logic to C++.


## Future Improvements
Gameplay:
* Migrate the rest of the BP code to C++.
* Fixing Camera movement.
* Use AI Behaviour Trees instead of directly AI nodes / Functions.
* AI Chasing Mechanic.

UI:
* High Scores Screen
* Pause Menu
